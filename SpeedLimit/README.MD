# Input

Bill and Ted are taking a road trip. But the odometer in their car is broken, so they don’t know how many miles they have driven. 
Fortunately, Bill has a working stopwatch, so they can record their speed and the total time they have driven. 
Unfortunately, their record keeping strategy is a little odd, so they need help computing the total distance driven.
You are to write a program to do this computation.


The input consists of one or more data sets. 
Each set starts with a line containing an integer, followed by pairs of values, one pair per line. 
The first value in a pair is the speed in miles per hour and the second value is the total elapsed time. 
The values for t are always in strictly increasing order. 
A value of -1 for n signals the end of the input.

Output
For each input set, print the distance driven, followed by a space, followed by the word “miles”.
