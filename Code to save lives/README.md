# Input
The input consists of 3 different segments:

The first line will have the number of test cases t, where 1 <= t <= 10.
The first line of each case will contain the first positive numerically distanced whole number, which will have the number’s digits, 0-9, be space-separated. 
The amount of digits in this line is m, where 1<= m <= 9.
The second line of each case will contain the second positive numerically distanced whole number, which will have the number’s digits, 0–9, be space-separated. 
The amount of digits in this line is n, where 1 <= n <= 9.

# Output
Output the sum of the numerically distanced numbers for each of the test cases on one line each.
