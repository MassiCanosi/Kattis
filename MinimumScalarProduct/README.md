# Input 

You are given two vectors v1 and v2.
Suppose you are allowed to permute the coordinates of each vector as you wish.
Choose two permutations such that the scalar product of your two new vectors is the smallest possible, and output that minimum scalar product.

The first line of the input file contains the number of testcases.
. For each test case, the first line contains integer number 'n'
. The next two lines contain 'n' integers each, giving the coordinates of v1 and v2 respectively.

# Output

For each test case, output a line

"Case #X: Y"

where:
 . X is the test case number, starting from 1 
 . Y is the minimum scalar product of all permutations of the two given vectors
