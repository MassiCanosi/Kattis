# ODD_MAN_OUT

You are hosting a party with guests and notice that there is an odd number of guests! When planning the party you deliberately invited only couples and gave each 
couple a unique number on their invitation. You would like to single out whoever came alone by asking all of the guests for their invitation numbers.

N test cases follow. For each test case there will be:

    1. One line containing the value the number of guests.
    2. One line containing a space-separated list of integers. Each integer indicates the invitation code of a guest.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing “Case #x: ” followed by the number of the guest who is alone.
